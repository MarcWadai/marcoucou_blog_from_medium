It was the last hour of strong will sitting. Since the first hour I understood why it was called strong will and determination. Challenging yourself to not move, not opening your eyes, continue your meditation under pain throbbing over your body. Fortunately, toward the end of the 10 days course, using the technique taught, I was able to stay still and calm. Peacefully.

On this very last day, we were taught the last part of Vipassana that is Mettā Bhāvanā meditation. 

> “Metta is a technique whereby we radiate loving-kindness and goodwill toward all beings, \[…\] _mettā_ gives us a way to share with all others the peace and harmony we are developing” by [VRI](https://www.vridhamma.org/research/The-Practice-of-Mett%C4%81-Bh%C4%81van%C4%81-in-Vipassana-Meditation)

It created such a strong vibration on my mind and body, that tears flowed down my cheeks. What happen to me during those 10 days, for someone that has so many difficulties to cry, to cry at the only thought of giving love and compassion.

### How those 10 days went for me

Inside the center, the rules are strict. You should respect noble silence ( no communication of any sort with anyone) durkng the entirety of the courses. The schedule are mostly similar everyday with a waking at 4am and closing light at 9:30pm. During this interval there is around 11h of meditation spread throughout the day
