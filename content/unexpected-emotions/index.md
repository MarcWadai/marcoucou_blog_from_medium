Looking at her eyes just made him feel happy. He was not thinking about anything else. He could stare at her for hours without getting bored. He was just happy being here, at this moment with her. Finding this strong feeling of connection and resonance with someone is such a beautiful feeling. Like in quantum physics when the spin of atom enter in resonance with the correct frequencies they change direction all together. Finding this connection with her took him into another world, until coming back to the usual direction.

Waking up with her in his arm was like waking up in a lucid dream. When you succeed entering it, you just rejoice the moment and atmosphere. Shaping together this dream without limit. Opening new doors of imagination and infinite power. The power of feeling alive while being in a dream. Creating a new reality.

Lying down besides her, sensing her body, her touch, her smell. Creating their own sparkling bubble. Building up a fireworks of emotion. 

First the emotion of fear. The fear of losing, losing her and losing one mind in this turbulent spiral of emotion.

Second the emotion of euphoria. The euphoria of the present moment

Third the emotion of vulnerability. The vulnerability of exposing one inner self.

Fourth the undescribable emotion. 

The coming down was hard. My feeling got so mix after this amazing

The day started as a normal day. Waking up, Reading, Exercising, coding eating etc.

Who would have thought that in year 3021 we still couls have emotions. Knowing that most of our emotion are control by machine. They will tell us in advance what to do in order to achieve the “best” experience possible using the most stable emotions. Of course our emotion ranking wont take a toll like this, and we will be able to keep our rank and their priviledges. Is it that hard to accept ?that the machine only wants what is good for you. proof of that the expectancy of life has extends by 100 years since the last 1000 years.
