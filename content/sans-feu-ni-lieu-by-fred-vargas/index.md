This book is a police story investigation book. The humour is really great, it has been a while since i have laugh while reading a book !

You really get attach quickly to the characters and try to search from beginning to end the solution to the case. How a life is fragile and that one event can make it change drastically for all your life. 

It shows some important characteristic about maternal love and protection. How your mother will always protect. 

It reminds you how a social network is important. Having friends and connection that will be here to help you in time of crisis. How your reputation will he

What I like was that the riddles and hint left by the author that are incredibly clever. 

The time of the story pass really slow, the entirety of the book is told for maybe a lenght of 10 days. Which is riddulously short !
