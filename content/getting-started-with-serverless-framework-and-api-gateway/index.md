When I first started using AWS lambda, I found it amazingly easy to create and link with other AWS services and use. One thing that I quickly realize was that the initial configuration, the manual deployment using AWS console, the port to new environment was becoming quickly cumbersome and not productive.

So serverless came to the rescue. Using a configuration file, you can create, modify, deploy lambdas in seconds. More beautifully, you can port your current AWS lambda structure into any other environment, with one command line. 

The original serverless documentation is complete but quite disparate. So on this article I will go from scratch to the deployment of an API gateway endpoint linked to lambdas, with documentation and using environment variable with AWS SSM.
