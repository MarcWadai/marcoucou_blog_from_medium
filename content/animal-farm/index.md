The story begin in a farm owned by Mr Jones. This farmed is composed of different animals, from pigs, cows, horses to duck, sheep, dogs etc. 

It’s until a certain point where revolution are necessary.

The revolution. One revolution will stir up another revolution, like a chain reaction. People are aware that it something is possible, something can be done and changed.

Fear to lose what we have from the old system, which is stability of life. To the unknown future that a new organizations will bring. 

Hierarchy inside the new revolution. Organization is what make a social cohabitation life possible. Arguments and debate are bound to happen in every organizations. 

Some people will always side with the old system. 

It is really interesting to see how power will breed more greed, once you enter his cage it is near impossible to escape. You won’t even realize you are trapped inside, but you are only digging deeper and deeper inside it. Creating an underground maze that will connect the caged people with each others. Living in a fake world driven by selfishness and materialism. Losing the Humanity they once had. Entering a never ending circle procreating more circles that will make us think this is the way.
