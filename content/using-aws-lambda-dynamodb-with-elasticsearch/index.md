#### Concept

#### GoalÂ 

  

-   AWS dynamodb is an awesome/ fast/cheap scalable No SQL database. However it lacks capabilities. like advanced search function (geospatial queries, data pagination etc ). Of course it can still be done using a mix of secondary index, composite keys and post processing, but at the end the code become quickly complicated. Consequently, I like to use the combination of dynamodb and search power of elastic search
-   What I am going to use here
